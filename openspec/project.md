# Project Context

## Purpose
Provide a retrieval-augmented generation framework for research and education teams that need configurable, private, and extensible assistants across chat, ticketing, and course-support workflows.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.7+
- Click-based CLI with Jinja2 templating
- Requests for HTTP integrations
- Containerized services using Podman + podman-compose
- mkdocs for documentation
- Optional data/science tooling used in pipelines or evaluation: pandas, matplotlib, ipython/ipykernel

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
- PEP 8 with 4-space indentation
- `snake_case` for modules/functions; `PascalCase` for classes
- Keep filenames descriptive (e.g., `test_interfaces.py`)
- Import ordering typically handled with isort when formatting is applied

### Architecture Patterns
- Core orchestration in `src/a2rchi/a2rchi.py` with pipelines in `src/a2rchi/pipelines/`
- CLI entrypoint in `src/cli/cli_main.py` with service/source registries in `src/cli/service_registry.py` and `src/cli/source_registry.py`
- Service entrypoints in `src/bin/` wire interfaces from `src/interfaces/`
- Runtime config loaded from `/root/A2rchi/configs/` via `src/utils/config_loader.py`
- CLI deployments render to `~/.a2rchi/a2rchi-<name>` (override with `A2RCHI_DIR`)

### Testing Strategy
- No formal testing setup yet; add tests as needed when introducing new behavior

### Git Workflow
- Use concise, lowercase commit summaries (e.g., "fix bug")
- PRs should include a brief summary, test results, and documentation impact; include screenshots/logs for UI or API changes

## Domain Context
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for research/education support
- Modular data ingestion connectors (web, git, local files, Jira, Redmine, etc.)
- Multiple interfaces/services (chatbot, ticketing assistant, email bot, etc.)
- Supports local and API-based LLM backends through configurable pipelines

## Important Constraints
- Must support private/offline-friendly deployments
- Config-driven behavior; deployments are generated by the CLI and run via container orchestration
- Python 3.7+ compatibility

## External Dependencies
- Container runtime and compose tooling: Podman and podman-compose
- Optional integrations based on configured sources/services (e.g., Jira, Redmine, Mattermost, Grafana)
- Optional model backends like HuggingFace or local model servers (e.g., Ollama), configured per deployment
